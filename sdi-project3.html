    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<article>
<p>My theme is my nightly free-time routine after the kids are in bed and once the house work and school work are completed.  For this project, I decided to go more into detail about playing COD Black Ops 2, by treyarch, online if my clan is available.  </p>
<p>In my project, I refer to the term "clan".  For those who do not play video games on-line and are not familiar with the term, it refers to a group of people who play as a team in on-line matches.  Also, I used the term gameMode to represent what kind of mode we will play.  For example "Kill Confirmed" is a game mode in COD Black Ops 2 where you kill and enemy and then have to collect their dog tag to get the full points.  "Capture the Flag" is a game mode where your goal as a team is to get the enemy flag and bring it back to your base while protecting the flag at your base.</p>
